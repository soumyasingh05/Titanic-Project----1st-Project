# Titanic-Project----1st-Project
#Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization - 

This is my first project in Python.
I will be doing my analysis on Titanic Disaster happened many years ago to find answers of questions mentioned below -

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)

2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3.) Where did the passengers come from?

4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

6.) Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate? Did this answer match up with your intuition?

7.) Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?

The analysis will be done using -

1.Pandas

2.Numpy

3.Matplotlib

4.Seaborn

Data set will be downloaded from Kaggle.com -

1.train.csv

2. test.csv
